# ArcGIS CityEngine for Unreal Engine - Cognitive Cities Edition

## üèôÔ∏è Distributed Architecture for Cognitive Cities

This repository extends [ArcGIS CityEngine for Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) to support the **distributed architecture of cognitive cities**. While maintaining full compatibility with the original CityEngine UE5 plugin for procedural building generation, this cognitive cities edition adds advanced capabilities for:

- **Distributed Urban Intelligence**: Neural networks for city-wide cognitive processing
- **Inter-Organizational Communication**: Protocols for cogpilot ‚Üî cogcities coordination  
- **Living Architecture**: Self-evolving urban systems with emergent behaviors
- **Cognitive Ecology**: Fractal organizational patterns for scalable city intelligence

### Original CityEngine Functionality

ArcGIS CityEngine for Unreal Engine is an [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) (UE5) plugin which enables the use of ArcGIS CityEngine shape grammar rules in UE5 for the generation of procedural buildings. Therefore, game designers or artists do not have to leave UE5 to make use of CityEngine‚Äôs procedural modeling power. The buildings stay procedural all time and artists can change the height, style and appearance of buildings easily with a parametric interface. In addition, buildings can also be generated at runtime.

As input the plugin requires rule packages (RPK) which are authored in CityEngine. An RPK includes assets and a CGA rule file which encodes an architectural style. The download section below provides links to the several RPKs which can be used out-of-the-box.

The latest release is available in the [downloads section on GitHub](https://github.com/Esri/vitruvio/releases/latest). Please refer to the [installation guide](doc/installation.md) for installation instructions. Examples can be downloaded from [ArcGIS CityEngine for Unreal Engine page](https://esri.github.io/cityengine/vitruvio#examples).
